# 🔥 LitGPT

The "Literature Review" part of academic papers can take a while to write, often misses some related sources, and doesn't keep up with new publications. LitGPT is a proof of concept showing how AI can change the way we do literature reviews. Simply provide your paper's title and abstract to see the results!

🧢 Because of the Github repo size cap, right now LitGPT only covers ML and AI papers from 2012 to 2019
🔒 The output quality is much better with GPT-4 but the API is not publicly available yet (And it's more expensive 💸)
📝 The number of papers is limited to 15 because of the ChatGPT context size limit.
